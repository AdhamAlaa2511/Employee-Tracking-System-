# 👨‍💻 Employee Tracking System Dashboard

### 📊 Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Analysis learning journey — focused on transforming raw employee activity data into actionable insights for performance tracking and management.
The goal was to analyze productivity patterns, project engagement, and software usage using a real-world simulated dataset from an Employee Tracking System.

🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)

I used Python (Pandas & NumPy) for data cleaning, transformation, and validation.
The dataset contained inconsistencies such as missing duration values, incorrect timestamps, and extreme outliers.

Steps performed:

Fixed incorrect FromDateTime and ToDateTime conversions.

Calculated new fields.

Handled null and missing values using median/mode replacement.

Removed duplicate or inaccurate activity records.

Stored the cleaned dataset separately to preserve the original raw data.

### 📈 Dashboard Design (Power BI)

The cleaned dataset was visualized in Power BI using DAX measures, relationships, and custom navigation buttons.
I designed a 4-page interactive dashboard with a clean modern theme and gradient sidebar for intuitive navigation.
